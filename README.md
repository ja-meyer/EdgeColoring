# EdgeColoring

Functions to make a proper (delta - 1) edge coloring on a simple graph. RandGraph generates a random graph while EdgeColor applies weights to the edges while ensuring that no more than delta - 1 "colors" are used. The file Math6420Project allows users to specifiy the number of vertices and maximum vertex degree.

There is an additional check to ensure that the coloring is proper by stating whether the edge coloring is proper and also by displaying a histogram for the edge weights.
